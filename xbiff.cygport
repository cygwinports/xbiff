CATEGORY="Mail"
SUMMARY="X mailbox indicator"
DESCRIPTION="The xbiff program displays a little image of a mailbox.  When
there is no mail, the flag on the mailbox is down.  When mail arrives, the
flag goes up and the mailbox beeps.  By default, pressing any mouse button in
the image forces xbiff to remember the current size of the mail file as being
the 'empty' size and to lower the flag."
